irc-bot
=======

an irc bot/bots that I'm working on for super happy funtimes in IRC at work

this is my first pass, it's awful, I need to do some refactoring and stuff so that all plugins are in files, not just in the bot ruby file. Other stuff too, like one top level file, to run multiple bots, or to limit plugins on a channel basis, or something.
